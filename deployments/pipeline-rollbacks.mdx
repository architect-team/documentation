title: "Pipeline rollbacks"

In order to do this, navigate to the pipeline history by selecting the "History"
tab on the sidebar of any environment page. This page shows a list of pipelines
in chronological order and whether or not they were successful. Any successful
pipeline can be reapplied. Details of any pipeline can be viewed by clicking
"Review >" in any of the pipeline rows. If re-running the pipeline will create
the desired state, rollback to it by clicking the "Rollback" button at the top
right of the pipeline page. This will create a new pipeline to apply the changes
which should be applied. If the pipeline review looks good, click the "Approve"
button at the top right of the page to rollback. Changes can be viewed in real
time either at the bottom of the pipeline review page or by clicking the "Live"
tab on the left side of the page.
