title: "Secrets"

Architect secrets can be anything ranging from log levels to production database credentials.
Whatever they may be, there are a number of ways for these secret values to be
provided, and this document will outline the available methods. We'll assume you
have registered the following two components:

```yaml
# ./component/architect.yml
name: component
dependencies:
  dependency: {}

secrets:
  secret_key:
    required: true

services:
  api:
    environment:
      SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.secret_key }}

# ./dependency/architect.yml
name: dependency

secrets:
  username:
    required: true
  password:
    required: true

services:
  dependency:
    environment:
      USERNAME: ${{ secrets.username }}
      PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.password }}
```

From the command line, the simplest way to specify secret values for components
is by doing so directly from the deploy command. The command supports a
`--secret` or `-s` flag that allows you to specify the secret key and value as follows:

```sh
$ architect deploy dependency -s username=my-username -s password=my-password
```

## Using a config file

Using the `--secret` flag is great for specifying values for individual
components, but doesn't allow you to specify values for component dependencies.
In order to specify secret values for your component _and_ it's dependencies,
something common when generating on-demand environments, you'll need to create a
secrets file. The Architect CLI supports two options: an Architect secrets file
in .yml format, or a .env file.

### Architect secrets file

```yaml
# secrets.yml
component:
  secret_key: my-secret-key

dependency:
  username: my-username
  password: my-password
```

This file can then be specified directly in the deploy command to apply values
to any components matching the keys in the file. The command below will deploy
component, and since it has a dependency, that will automatically be deployed
as well. Each component's name matches a key in the file above so all the required
secrets will be fulfilled.

```sh
$ architect deploy component --secret-file secrets.yml
```

The keys in the secrets file are simply patterns for matching components. Some
examples are:

```yaml
"*": # applies to all components in your account
  ...
foo-api: # applies to all versions of the foo-api component
  ...
foo-api@instance2: # applies to only the foo-api tenant named "instance2"
  ...
```

### .env file

Architect also supports loading secrets from a .env file such as the one below.
Secrets parsed from a .env file will be mapped to any component that expects the
secret name. Rules for parsing a .env file can be found
[here](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#what-rules-does-the-parsing-engine-follow)
and variables can be expanded during loading following the rules defined in
[dotenv-expand](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv-expand).

```
secret_key=my-secret-key
username=my-username
password=my-password
```

Deploying a component using secrets from a .env file is the same as with an
Architect secrets file. Just specify the name of the file after the
`--secret-file` flag.

```sh
$ architect deploy component --secret-file .env
```

## Using the ARC_ prefix

Environment variables set in a shell and prefixed with `ARC_` will be picked up by the `dev` and `deploy` commands.
This means that if a component requires the secret `secret_key`, setting `ARC_secret_key` in the terminal from which the `dev` or `deploy` command is run will fulfill the value for that secret. For example:

```sh
export ARC_secret_key=my-super-secret-key
architect deploy my-component -e my-environment -a my-account
```

Settings secrets this way can be useful in cases where secrets should be set, but never directly included in a secrets file or as part of a command.

## From the UI

Storing environment configuration in a file is handy for local development, but
not ideal for production-grade credentials. In order to provide comparable,
secure support for production secrets and values, Architect Cloud allows
secrets to be registered with each environment. Simply navigate to the
"Secrets" tab on your environment to fill out the corresponding values:

Once filled out, each deployment to the corresponding environment will be
automatically enriched with matching values.

## Order of precedence

Since there are three different methods by which you can provide secrets, you
may be wondering what happens if you use more than one. Architect interprets
provided secret values in the following order:

1. `--secret` flag (highest priority)
2. `--secret-file` flag
3. Environment secrets (lowest priority)
