title: "Multi-tenant deployments"
---

The default deployment process will create an instance of the component as an
unnamed global tenant, but you can deploy a separate instance by providing a
tenanat name. Having multiple instances of a component deployed in this manner
is called a "multi-tenant deployment".

```
architect deploy react-app@app1
```

This process works for updating existing deployments as well. If an "app1"
tenant of the `examples/react-app` component had already been deployed, the
above command would have deployed to that same tenant, leaving any other
instances of the component untouched.

## Deployments and management lifecycle

When you view your deployed components, you'll see that the react-app has the
name "app1" whereas the typical deployment without a tenant name will show only
the component. In this example we've deployed the example React App twice with
the tenant names "app1" and "app2", and once without a tenant name.

## Secrets and values

Configuring individual tenants works the same way as deploying those tenants: by
providing the tenant name. Secrets use the component scopes to specify which
values will be applied to which components, so setting a secret for a tenant is
as simple as providing the tenant name in the component scope.

In the case of the example React App, the following will override the
`world_text` secret for just the `sandiego` tenant.

```yaml
"react-app@sandiego":
  world_text: San Diego
```

This enables minimal duplication of configuration, as you can specify any
necessary values in a generic component scope, but then override specific values
on a tenant-by-tenant basis. In the following example, the `planetearth` tenant
would have the `foo` secret as configured in the first scope, but would have the
overwritten values for w`orld_text` set in the second scope.

```yaml
"react-app":
  foo: bar
  world_text: world!
"react-app@planetearth":
  world_text: Planet Earth
```

## Automating deployments

Want to make it as easy as possible for your team to create tenants? Try creating a tenant file in your
repository that gets read in by your CI jobs to automate deployments.

```json ./tenants.json
[
  {
    "name": "cool-customer",
    "description": "The coolest of customers",
    "owner": "thor@architect.io"
  },
  {
    "name": "rad-customer",
    "description": "The raddest of customers",
    "owner": "ironman@architect.io"
  }
]
```

### Setting up the workflow

With a file like that in the root of your repository, you can iterate over the list of tenants 
directly in your CI workflow.
