A starter project is a sample application that contains an `architect.yml` file so it can be deployed as an
Architect component.
We provide starter projects in different languages and frameworks for you to use to learn how to deploy with
Architect. Our goal is to give you a familiar learning environment.

Each starter project has a component spec file, `architect.yml`, that defines how the
application should be deployed. Instructions on how you can run the application
locally or deploy it remotely to the Architect Cloud are also described. Learn
more about the [architect.yml](/reference/architect-yml) file.
