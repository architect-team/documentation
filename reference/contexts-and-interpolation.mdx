title: "Contexts and interpolation"
---

When writing `architect.yml` files, you can reference information about the
runtime or environment, details that are otherwise unique to each deployed
environment, through Architect's expression syntax. Encoding component's with
these references can help limit the manual configuration needs of your services
and make them portable from environment to environment.

## Available contexts

There are several context groups that contain important, dynamic information
about your component and its future deployed environment. Below are the context
categories available for reference:

| Context name   | Description                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dependencies` | References to the dynamic outputs of each dependency and their interfaces |
| `secrets`      | Dynamic values for the secrets declared by your component                 |
| `services`     | References to the dynamic outputs of each service and their interfaces    |

### `dependencies` context

The `dependencies` context contains dynamic information about the dependencies
of the component. This context can primarily be used to refer to the internal
addresses of dependency interfaces.

| Property                                                   | Type     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dependencies`                                             | `object` | Information about the component's dependencies                                                                               |
| `dependencies.<dependency>`                                | `object` | Information about the specified dependency                                                                                   |
| `dependencies.<dependency>.interfaces`                     | `object` | Information about the dependency's interfaces                                                                                |
| `dependencies.<dependency>.interfaces.<interface>`         | `object` | Information about the specified interface of the dependency. [See the interface values](#interface-values) for more details. |
| `dependencies.<dependency>.interfaces.<interface>.ingress` | `object` | Information about the specified interface of the dependency. [See the interface values](#interface-values) for more details. |

### `ingresses` context

The `ingresses` context contains information about the external exposed
interfaces.

| Property                | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ingresses`             | `object` | Information on the ingress rules of the component                                                                                          |
| `ingresses.<interface>` | `object` | Information on an ingress rule matching the interface. [See the interface values](/reference/contexts-and-interpolation/#interface-values) for more details. |

### `secrets` context

The `secrets` context contains all the values assigned to each secret declared
by your component.

| Property        | Type     | Description                                   |
| --------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `secrets`       | `object` | A dictionary containing the secret values     |
| `secrets.<key>` | `string` | Resolves to the value of the specified secret |

### `services` context

The `services` context contains dynamic information about all the services
inside the component. This context can primarily be used to refer to the
interfaces of other services inside the component.

| Property                                            | Type     | Description                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `services`                                          | `object` | Information about each service inside the component                                                                |
| `services.<service>`                                | `object` | Information specific to one of the named services inside the component                                             |
| `services.<service>.interfaces`                     | `object` | Information about the specified service's interfaces                                                               |

| `services.<service>.interfaces.<interface>.ingress` | `object` | Information about the specified service interface. [See the interface values](#interface-values) for more details. |

### `interface values`

Interface values are referenced in many places, `dependencies` and `services` with a set of uniform values available to reference. These values include:

| Property | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Description |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| url      | The fully composed URL of the reference interface. This will take the format, `<protocol>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port><path>`.                                                                                                                         |
| protocol | The protocol of the interface being referenced. This will always be the specific value assigned to the interface by the developer.                                                                                                                              |
| username | The username of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have usernames, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                                                                                                              |
| password | The password of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have passwords, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                                                                                                              |
| host     | The host value of the interface being referenced. This value is usually dynamic to accomodate the differences between service discovery solutions available to each environment.                                                                                |
| port     | The port value of the interface being referenced. This will not always be the specific port that the interface is listening on as many container clusters leverage port mapping to ensure that there are no port collisions when sharing hardware in a cluster. |
| path     | The path value of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have paths, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                         |

## Interpolation

Interpolation is used in the `architect.yml` component configuration file to reference values in contexts defined by Architect.
Common use cases for interpolation include referencing the address of another service within the component, the address of a dependent component,
a secret of the component, an ingress of a service, and more. An interpolation reference always starts with `${{` and ends with `}}`.
When the component is deployed with either [`architect dev`](/reference/cli#architect-dev-configs-or-components) or [`architect deploy`](/reference/cli#architect-deploy-configs-or-components),
any interpolation references in the component file will be populated with real values.

### Examples of common use cases

#### Referencing a secret

Secrets will frequently be defined in the component configuration file and will be populated when the component is deployed. It will then be referenced in a part of a service,
such as the environment block.

```yml
# architect.yml
name: app

secrets:
  api_key:

services:
  app:
    environment:
      API_KEY: ${{ secrets.api_key }}
...
```

#### Referencing the internal address of another service

Services within the same component will often need to reference one another within the same network.
In the example below, the "app" service references the internal address of the "api" service.

```yml
# architect.yml
name: my-component

services:
  app:
    environment:
      API_ADDRESS: ${{ services.api.interfaces.main.url }}

  api:
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
...
```

#### Referencing the external address of another service

Services within the same component will sometimes need to reference one another from outside of the network. A common case is when a frontend application needs to make calls to an
API from a browser. In the example below, the "app" service references the external, public-facing address of the "api" service. The external address of the API service is generated
automatically by Architect when the component is deployed.

```yml
# architect.yml
name: my-component

services:
  app:
    environment:
      API_ADDRESS: ${{ services.api.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}

  api:
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
...
```

#### Referencing the address of a dependency

In certain cases, a component will reference another Architect component as a dependency, and an address of a service within that dependency will need to be referenced.
Take the following example of two components, where the "api" component is a dependency of the "app" component.

```yml
# architect.yml of the api component
name: api

services:
  api:
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
...
```

```yml
# architect.yml of the app component
name: app

dependencies:
  api: latest

services:
  app:
    environment:
      API_ADDRESS: ${{ dependencies.api.services.api.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}
...
```

### Example of a simple component with interpolation

The following example component uses the Docker image built by our "node-rest-api" [example project](https://github.com/architect-templates/node-rest-api) and connects the API to a Postgres database.
`${{ services.database.interfaces.main.url }}` is used to allow the database to connect to the API. When the component is deployed, the interpolation reference will be replaced by an automatically-generated
network address where the database service can be reached. Secrets are passed to each service with secret interpolation such as `${{ secrets.db_name }}`. The secret interpolation references
will be replaced by actual secret values when the component is deployed.

```yml
# architect.yml
name: api-example

secrets:
  db_user:
    default: architect
  db_pass:
    default: secret
  db_name:
    default: api-db

services:
  # Application service
  api:
    image: registry.gitlab.com/architect-io/docker-files/sample-backend:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
    environment:
      DB_ADDR: ${{ services.database.interfaces.main.url }}/${{ secrets.db_name }}
      DB_USER: ${{ secrets.db_user }}
      DB_PASS: ${{ secrets.db_pass }}
      PORT: 8080

  # Database service
  database:
    image: postgres:12
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 5432
        protocol: postgresql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${{ secrets.db_user }}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.db_pass }}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${{ secrets.db_name }}
```
