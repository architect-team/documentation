## Breaking Change: Deprecation of `path` and `port` for `liveness_probe`

The `path` and `port` options of [`liveness_probe`](/components/services#liveness-probe) are being deprecated, and support will end on August 2023. Instead, use the `command` option for defining your liveness probe.

### Who does this change affect?

This change affects all users who are currently using the `path` and `port` options in their `liveness_probe` configuration. If you are one of them, please update your configuration to use the `command` option before August to avoid any disruptions in your application's health checks.

### Why are we making this change?

We are making this change to favor the `command` option, as it provides more flexibility in defining the liveness probe command as well as fixing an issue that could potentially arise if incorrect IP Address is passed to the `liveness_probe`.

### What do you need to do?

1. Remove all uses of `path` and `port` for the `liveness_probe` in your component configs.
2. Add `command` for the `liveness_probe` and **re-register any changed components**.

The `liveness_probe` command specified in the `architect.yml` file will be executed periodically to determine the health of the container. If the command exits with a status code of 0, the container is considered healthy. However, if the command exits with a non-zero status code, the container is considered unhealthy and the health check will be retried according to the number of retries if specified.

### Examples

Example - if you were using `path` and `port` within your component config as shown below:

```yml
services:
  app:
    liveness_probe:
      port: 3000
      path: /
```

You would change this to use a `command` with `curl` or `wget`, depending on which is installed on your image.

```yml
services:
  app:
    liveness_probe:
      command: curl --fail localhost:3000
```

```yml
services:
  app:
    liveness_probe:
      command: wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider localhost:3000
```

# February 2023

## Breaking Change: Replace parameters with secrets keyword

Last year we introduced the `secrets` keyword and other CLI flags such as `-s` to replace the `parameters` keyword. Now itâ€™s time to fully deprecate the use of the `parameters` keyword and flag(s) throughout component configs and our CLI.

### Who does this change affect?

This is a **breaking change** that affects anyone who utilizes the `parameters` keyword and flag(s), both in the component configs and in Architect CLI.


### Why are we making this change?

Throughout the next year we plan to make several improvements to secrets handling in the component config files. By ensuring use of the `secrets` keyword we ensure customers can take advantage of these improvements.

Additionally, we are committed to reducing complexity and increasing clarity by eliminating redundancies where possible.


### What do you need to do?



1. Remove all uses of the parameters keyword in your component configs, and in any scripts that issue CLI commands.
2. Replace all uses of `parameters` with the `secrets` keyword and **re-register all components**.
3. Change any `architect deploy` commands to use the `-s` flag instead of the `-p `flag.

Again, this is a **breaking change** that will take effect **on or about 8 Feb, 2023**.

If you have any questions or concerns feel free to reach out to us via Slack (for customers who have access to us there), or you can file a support ticket at support.architect.io or send email to support@architect.io.

### Examples

Example: if you were using `parameters` on the top level of the component config:


```yml
parameters:
 AUTH_CLIENT_ID:
    required: true
  AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET:
    required: true
```


You would change this to:


```yml
secrets:
  AUTH_CLIENT_ID:
    required: true
  AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET:
    required: true
```


Or if your interpolation reference for an environment variable looks like


```yml
environment:
  NODE_ENV: ${{ parameters.NAME }}
```


then it should be changed to


```yml
environment:
  NODE_ENV: ${{ secrets.NAME }}
```

<br/>
If you issue a command like


```
[...] -p key=value [...]
```


Or (the non shorthand version)


```
[...] --parameter key=value [...]
```


then it should be changed to


```
[...] -s key=value  [...]
```


or (the non-shorthand version):


```
[...] --secret key=value [...]
```
