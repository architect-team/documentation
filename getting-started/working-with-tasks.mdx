title: "Working with tasks"
---

Architect components have the concept of a **Task**, similar to a cron job.
Since Tasks are defined in a component in a similar way to Services, you can
configure your Tasks with dependencies on other components, take secrets, or
call a service defined in the same component.

This guide will walk through the process of creating a new component with a Task
that exercises most of the features available to Tasks.

1. Create an example container and script to run as a Task
2. Defining a minimal Component with a Task, and execute it locally
3. Updating the Component to improve local development experience
4. Tasks with Secrets
5. Tasks with Dependencies

## Create a Script and Dockerfile for our Task

Before getting started with the components, create a script for your task, and a
dockerfile so you can bake the script into an image.

```shell
% mkdir ./my-task
% cd ./my-task
% touch Dockerfile my-task.sh
```

The `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM alpine:3.14
COPY my-task.sh /my-task.sh
CMD ["sh", "-c", "/my-task.sh"]
```

The `my-task.sh`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh
echo "${GREETING:-Hello}, world!"
```

With those created, go ahead and build the docker image and execute it, just to
verify it's working as expected.

```shell
% docker build . -t my-task:latest -q
sha256:d7116f02d2220db058c3df25417894fae557ae55875c9abb5f14946aa6c9b8ee

% docker run my-task:latest
Hello, world!

% docker run -e GREETING=Hola my-task:latest
Hola, world!
```

You can see that when the task runs without the `GREETING` environment variable,
it displayed the typical "Hello, world!", but will provide a more customized
message when the `GREETING` variable is provided. With the docker image working,
proceed with creating the Architect Component and Task.

## Define a Minimal Component Task

In your `my-task` directory, create an architect file to define your component:

```
touch architect.yml
```

Now you can create a Task in the component file just as you would a Service. In
this case you'll give the component a brief description, a blank schedule so it
runs only when manually executed, and finally you provide the build context as
the local directly. The [Component Task docs](/components/tasks) cover all the
nuances in the task definition, as do the
[Task Reference docs](/reference/architect-yml).

The `architect.yml`:

```yaml
name: my-task
description: A hello world task! ðŸ‘‹

tasks:
  hello-world:
    schedule: ""
    build:
      context: ./
```

You can validate the component to verify aren't any mistakes:

```shell
% architect validate ./architect.yml
âœ… my-task: /Users/test/development/my-task/architect.yml
```

To run this locally, you'll need to link the component by running:

```shell
% architect link ./architect.yml
Successfully linked my-task to local system at /Users/test/development/my-task/architect.yml.
```

Now that the component is linked, you can deploy it locally using the
`architect dev` command. Under the hood, this creates a docker-compose file
which will be used as the task is executed.

```shell
% architect dev my-task
...
```

And now you can execute the task locally:

```shell
% architect task:exec --local my-task hello-world
Running task my-task/hello-world:latest in the local architect environment...

Creating architect-task-hello-world-xhkltnus_run ...
Creating architect-task-hello-world-xhkltnus_run ... done
Hello, world!


Successfully ran task.
```

And there you have it; you've executed your task locally! But you may want to
improve the component definition to reduce friction during development.

## Local Task Development

Development generally requires rapid iteration, and needing to run `dev` and
`task:exec` each time you want to test can be a tedious experience. To alleviate
this, you can make use of the `debug` feature to mount our source code when you
run the task without having to re-deploy. This can be achieved by updating the
component with a debug block, re-deploying (just the once) to update the
component configuration. You will only use a few of the available local
development features, but more info can be found in the
[Local Configuration docs](/components/local-configuration).

Now you can update the architect file with the debug block containing a volume
mount that overrides the script in the container with the script from the local
filesystem:

```diff
tasks:
   hello-world:
     schedule: ""
     build:
       context: ./
+    debug:
+      volumes:
+        src:
+          mount_path: /my-task.sh
+          host_path: ./my-task.sh
```

You will have to redeploy the component because you changed its definition, so
go ahead and redeploy and execute it again to make sure everything is still
working as expected.

```
% architect dev my-task
...
% architect task:exec --local my-task hello-world
...
Hello, world!
```

Excellent! With this version of your component, the `my-task.sh` script is being
mounted into the container and used when the task is executed. You should make a
change to the script and re-execute the task to verify this:

Change the `my-task.sh` file to include a waving emoji in the output:

```diff
#!/usr/bin/env sh
-echo "${GREETING:-Hello}, world!"
+echo "${GREETING:-Hello}, world! ðŸ‘‹"
```

Now you'll see the emoji in the output when you execute the task again without
re-registering or re-deploying the component:

```shell
% architect task:exec --local my-task hello-world
...
Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹
```

## Tasks with Secrets

The task you created supports a `GREETING` environment variable, so you can make
use of that as you deploy the component by setting a value as a secret. In
addition to adding the `secrets` section to the component, you'll also need to
declare the `GREETING` environment variable on the task, and assign it to the
value given by the secret. More information about secrets can be found in the
[Components Secrets docs](/components/secrets) and the
[Secrets Reference docs](/reference/architect-yml).

The `architect.yml` file:

```yaml
name: my-task
 description: A hello world task! ðŸ‘‹
+secrets:
+  greeting:
+    required: false
+    description: The greeting to use
+
 tasks:
   hello-world:
     schedule: ""
     build:
       context: ./
+    environment:
+      GREETING: ${{ secrets.greeting }}
     debug:
       volumes:
         src:
```

Now you can redeploy the component with a secret value, whose value will be used
when the task is executed. It's important to understand that these secrets are
set at deploy time, so you cannot re-declare the `GREETING` value later when you
execute the task.

```
% architect dev my-task -s greeting=Hola
...
% architect task:exec --local my-task hello-world
Hola, world! ðŸ‘‹
...
```

## Tasks with Dependencies

As mentioned earlier, tasks can use the same facilities as services which also
means a Task can depend on a Service, just as Services can depend on other
Services. So you can expand the component to include a service for generating
names to use in your task's greeting.

To start, add a really simple node server in a file called `server.js`, and make
a dedicated docker image.

```shell
% mkdir ./server
% touch ./server/server.js
% touch ./server/Dockerfile
```

The `server/server.js`:

```js
const http = require("http");

const names = ["April", "Katie", "Marlon", "Darnell", "Simon", "Lena", "Noah"];

const requestListener = function (req, res) {
  const name = names[(names.length * Math.random()) | 0];
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end(name);
};

const server = http.createServer(requestListener);
server.listen(9000);
```

The `server/Dockerfile`:

```
FROM node:16-alpine3.11
COPY server.js /server.js
CMD ["node", "/server.js"]
```

The server will respond with just the name in the body, so you can update the
script to simply curl the server address provided by the `API_URL` variable.

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh
-echo "${GREETING:-Hello}, world! ðŸ‘‹"
+echo "${GREETING:-Hello}, $(curl -s $API_URL)! ðŸ‘‹"
```

Now go ahead and add the service to the architect file, and then pass the URL
for the service into the task using the environment variable referenced in the
script:

```diff
required: false
     description: The greeting to use
+services:
+  name-generator:
+    build:
+      context: ./server
+    interfaces:
+      main:
+        port: 9000
+
 tasks:
   hello-world:
     schedule: ""
@@ -13,6 +24,7 @@ tasks:
       context: ./
     environment:
       GREETING: ${{ secrets.greeting }}
+      API_URL: ${{ services.name-generator.interfaces.main.url }}
     debug:
       volumes:
         src:
```

Great! Now you can deploy your changes.

```shell
% architect dev --detached my-task -s greeting=Hola
Building containers... done

Once the containers are running they will be accessible via the following urls:
http://localhost:50006/ => my-task-name-generator-0s8tot3o:9000

Starting containers...
```

And now when you execute the task again, you'll see a greeting for a random name
provided by the dependent service:

```
% architect task:exec --local my-task hello-world ... Hola, Katie! ðŸ‘‹
```
