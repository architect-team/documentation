  "Architect.io centers the needs of developers to create deployment pipelines
  without needing to know about the operational details of building and
  maintining modern devops infrastructure."

Developers love Architect because it emulates tools they use and love already,
like NPM, to describe their application architecture and declare its
dependencies. DevOps engineers love Architect because our automation makes
deployments flexible, dynamic, and secure so that DevOps can focus on other,
value generating initiatives to support develoeprs rather than constrining them
unnecessarily.

How do we do this? -- Use Docker to make deployments portable -- Use a file
(architect.yml) to describe your app's structure and dependency -- Provide a
single command to deploy locally, to preview environments, or to production

## First steps

There are two ways to get started with Architect. First, you may create an
account at Architect.io and connect a github repository and start deploying
code, all through our web based UI. Second, you may install our CLI app to run
'deploy' commands directly from your local machine. We'll guide you through the
steps to get started using the second method (CLI).

Before you do anything else, install Docker and NPM in case you haven't already.

## Install the CLI

The best way to install the CLI is via NPM:

```bash
$ npm install -g @architect-io/cli
```

Alternatively, you can download the binary for your system architecture from
[Github](https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli/releases/tag/v1.32.1).
Just download the appropriate bundle, extract it, and link the included `bin`
folder to your user home directory.

## Run a sample component

In order to help you get familiar with Architect, we've created several
[example applications](https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli/tree/rc/examples)
for you to experiement with. In this walk through, we'll use the react demo
application which comes with a frontend Next.js app, a backend Node.js API, and
a postgres database â€“ all of which will be deployed automatically via Architect:

### Clone the repository

The examples live in a sub-folder of our CLI's repository, so go ahead and clone
the repo locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/architect-team/architect-cli.git && cd ./architect-cli/
```

### Register the app locally

Next you'll want to link the react application to your local registry. Linking
helps the CLI find the component by name on the local file system, otherwise it
would look to find the component in Architect's component registry.

```sh
$ architect link ./examples/react-app/
```

### Check out the architect.yml file

<Card

/>

The `architect.yml` file contains the component descriptors that power Architect
deployments. Why don't you open up the file in the react-app example:

```yaml
name: react-app

secrets:
  world_text:
    description: Default greeting text for the landing page
    default: world
  root_db_user:
    description: Root user to assign to the generated database
    default: postgres
  root_db_pass:
    description: Root password to assign to the generated database
    default: architect
  api_db_name:
    description: Name of the database used by the API
    default: test_database

services:
  # Describes the database service
  api-db:
    image: postgres:11
    interfaces:
      postgres:
        port: 5432
        protocol: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${{ secrets.root_db_user }}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.root_db_pass }}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${{ secrets.api_db_name }}

  # Describes the Node.js backend API
  api:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    interfaces:
      main: &api-port 8080
    environment:
      PORT: *api-port
      DB_ADDR: ${{ services.api-db.interfaces.postgres.url }}
      DB_USER: ${{ secrets.root_db_user }}
      DB_PASS: ${{ secrets.root_db_pass }}
      DB_NAME: ${{ secrets.api_db_name }}
    # The debug block defines features only used for local deployments. In this
    # case, we've mounted to src directory and instrumented a hot-reloading cmd
    debug:
      command: npm run start:dev
      volumes:
        src:
          mount_path: /usr/src/app/src
          host_path: ./backend/src

  # Describes the Next.js frontend application
  app:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: &app-port 8080
        ingress:
          # Maps the frontend application to an external interface. Once running, it can
          # be resolved at https://app.localhost.architect.sh
          subdomain: app
    environment:
      PORT: *app-port
      API_ADDR: ${{ services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
      WORLD_TEXT: ${{ secrets.world_text }}
    debug:
      build:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      volumes:
        src:
          mount_path: /usr/src/app/src
          host_path: ./frontend/src
```

This `architect.yml` describes each of our three `services`, exposes the
frontend externally via `interfaces`, and allows the root database credentials
to be configured via `secrets`.

### Run the component

Now that you have a better understanding of what you're deploying, go ahead and
start it up!

```sh
$ architect dev react-app

Using locally linked react-app found at /architect-cli/examples/react-app
https://app.localhost.architect.sh:443/ => react-app--app

https://localhost:443/ => gateway:443
https://localhost:8080/ => gateway:8080
https://localhost:50000/ => react-app--api-db:5432
https://localhost:50001/ => react-app--api:8080
https://localhost:50002/ => react-app--app:8080
# begin log stream...
```

The command above will transform the component into a fully enriched
docker-compose template and then execute it automatically. After a few seconds
you should see the each application indicate that its ready for traffic, and at
that point you can open https://app.localhost.architect.sh in your browser!

## Make your own changes

As you may have noticed from the `architect.yml` file, there is a `debug` block
that enables hot-reloading for each service. That means you can make changes to
the source code for each project and the changes will be applied to the
environment automatically.

Why don't you try making some changes to
`./frontend/src/components/NameComponent.jsx`? Find the line that says:

```jsx
Hello {this.state.changed_name}
```

and change it to say:

```jsx
Hi there {this.state.changed_name}
```

Once you save the file, you'll see the frontend service recompiling in the logs
and then your browser window will update automatically.

## Create a free Architect account

Now that you've successfully run and edited a component locally, it's time to
learn how to register the component and deploy it to cloud environments. Before
you can do that however, you need to
[sign up](https://cloud.architect.io/signup) for Architect and create an account
that will house your components and environments.

After you've signed up, you simply need to login via the CLI to allow for access
to your account:

Copy $ architect login

## Register a component

Before you can deploy to a cloud environment, you have to register and tag your
component with Architect's component registry. Components are registered to the
account indicated by the name prefix of each component. The component you've
been using as an example is called `react-app`, but lets go ahead and change the
account prefix before registering. Open up the `architect.yml` file and change
the name to something of your choosing. Once that's complete, you can register
the component with a single command:

```sh
$ architect register ./examples/react-app/architect.yml --tag latest --account <account-name>
```

The `register` command does three things: 1) builds any services with a `build`
and replaces the field with an `image` field referencing the built artifact, 2)
uploads any build artifacts to Architect's registry, and 3) registers the
component itself with Architect. Once complete, you'll see a link to the newly
registered component!

## Deploy to the cloud

Finally, you're ready to deploy! Each Architect account comes pre-registered
with an environment named, `example-environment`, that leverages Architect as
the hosting provider. Go ahead and deploy your component to it (be sure to
replace `<account-name>` with the name of the account you where you registered
your component):

```sh
$ architect deploy react-app:latest --account <account-name> --environment example-environment
```

Nice work! Now that you've gotten the hang of the deploy flow, you're probably
ready to try it out with your own application. Head on over to the
[configuration](/components/architect-yml) section to learn more about the
`architect.yml` file and how to write one of your own!
