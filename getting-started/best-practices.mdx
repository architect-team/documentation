Follow these best practices to help you get the most out of Architect.

## Components
These are some best practices to keep in mind when creating components.

### Component names

A [component](./../tutorial/create-a-component) name is used in the `architect.yml` component file that defines
services, tasks, interfaces, and secrets. A component name can include lowercase
letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Component names can't start or end
with a dash or underscore. The maximum length is 32 characters.

Examples:

```
my-component
my-component-2
my_third_component
```

Example usage:

```yaml
# architect.yml
---
name: my-component
```

### Component versions

An architect component version, or tag, is created when a component is
[registered](/reference/cli/#architect-register-component) with Architect.
The `--tag` or `-t` flag of the `architect register` command can be used
to specify the name of the version. Architect components can have multiple
versions similar to any package manager. Component versions can contain
alphanumeric characters, periods, dashes, and underscores. The maximum length of
a component version is 128 characters.

Examples:

```
0.0.1
second-version
third_component_version
```

Example usage:

```sh
architect register architect.yml --tag=0.0.1
```

or

```sh
architect register architect.yml -t 0.0.1
```

## Parameterizing services

Your service definitions should parameterize any values that are likely to change between local development and
deploying to production.

[Secrets](/deployments/secrets) should be defined in the `architect.yml`
component file for configurable values between local or remote deployments. This
ensures that applications maintain portability.

Examples include:

- An environment variable that needs to change between dev and prod
- A value for the desired number of replicas for a service
- An API key for a third-party service that helps to power your application

Secrets help avoid hardcoded values for things that may change between local
development and production, such as an API address or a database
username and password.

Similarly, services defined in the component configuration file don't need to use
hardcoded values when referencing one another. This is because Architect will
dynamically detect connections between services and dependencies and generate
them at deployment time. This applies to both
[service](/components/service-discovery) and
[dependency](/components/dependencies) references.

## Interpolation

Architect component configuration files are meant to be used to deploy applications to any environment, whether that's local or remote.
Because of this, things that can change between environments such as service addresses and secrets should be referenced by [interpolation](/reference/contexts-and-interpolation#interpolation).

## Volumes

Volumes are important in both local and production deployments to persist data
between container lifecycles.

### Local volumes

Local deployments can use volumes within the `debug` block of the `architect.yml` file to support hot reloading.

#### Hot reloading

[Hot reloading](/components/local-configuration/#hot-reloading) allows users to
make changes to their application or component without the need to redeploy.
Code is shared between the host machine and the container running the
application. This feature is only needed for local deployments, so a volume is
configured through a `debug` block within the `architect.yml` file.

Below is an example using a volume in the debug block:

```yaml
# architect.yml
---
services:
  my-service:
    debug:
      volumes:
        src:
          mount_path: /usr/src/app/src # The location of the code within the Docker container
          host_path: ./api/src # The location of the code relative to the architect.yml file on the host machine
```

Note that the application running in the container must be configured to
support hot reloading. This will vary depending on your framework. For example,
Node applications can implement hot reloading by utilizing the
[nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package.

#### Debug volumes

[Data persistence](/components/local-configuration/#persisting-data) should also
be considered when running local deployments with `architect dev`. Using volumes,
data can be shared between the container and the host machine so that even as
the local stack spins up and down, the data being used to debug won't disappear.
This is especially useful in cases where it's important to retain data from a
database.

This is an example of mounting a local database volume when running locally in `debug` mode:

```yaml
# architect.yml
---
services:
  api-db:
    image: postgres:14
    interfaces:
      postgres:
        port: 5432
        protocol: postgresql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: api_database
    debug:
      volumes:
        data:
          mount_path: /var/lib/api/postgres
```

<Warning>
  Setting only the `mount_path` of a debug volume will automatically provision a
  Docker volume on the host machine. In order to store the data directly on the
  host machine instead of inside of a Docker volume, include a `host_path` as
  well.
</Warning>

<Warning>
    When changing the service name, the volume name, or the architect dev environment name (via `architect dev -e <env-name>`),
    a new volume will be provisioned if `mount_path` is used in the volume config without a `host_path`.
</Warning>

### Remote volumes

Data stored directly on the filesystem of a Kubernetes pod won't be persisted. For
that reason, important data should be stored in a
volume and added to the service similar to the following:

```yaml
# architect.yml
---
services:
  my-service:
    volumes:
      my-volume:
        mount_path: /usr/app/images
        key: my-persistent-volume-claim
```

## Service dependencies

When using a service that depends on another service that must be fully operational
first, a [`depends_on`](/components/services/#depends_on) block can be added to
the service definition of the dependent service. An example of this is an API
requiring a database service to run before the API can start up. The
`depends_on` block ensures that services are deployed sequentially.

Take a simple web service named `my-service` which will fail to start if it
cannot connect to the `database` service. A `depends_on` block can be added to
`my-service` to ensure that the database has been spun up before trying
to start `my-service`.

Below is a snippet of an `architect.yml` file to demonstrate what this would
look like.

```yaml
# architect.yml
---
services:
  my-service:
    depends_on:
      - database
---
database:
  interfaces:
    postgres:
      port: 5432
```

## Ensuring service health

The Architect service configuration includes a `liveness_probe` block to configure
a check that ensures service health. It can let a container environment know
when to restart a service if the container becomes unhealthy.
When configuring the command for the liveness probe, ensure that the command
used (ie `curl`) is installed in the Docker image for the service.
