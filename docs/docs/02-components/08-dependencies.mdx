description: Integrate with other APIs using common dependency management tactics

import { Button } from '@site/src/components/Button';

Historically cloud teams have tried to avoid dependencies and coupling between microservices and
APIs because it creates a lot of infrastructure and CI/CD complexity. However, its all too natural
for developers to try to extend what exists rather than reinvent it, and many teams ended up with
complex webs of microservices nonetheless.

Fortunately, this problem of "dependencies" has been solved before. Every language and operating
system on earth has tools for dependency management to help developers collaborate and extend each
others work. Now Architect is here to provide the same value for APIs and microservices.

## Why use dependencies?

Citing dependencies as part of your component is not the most natural way for developers to
integrate with software made by other teams, but its also the only way to achieve
[on-demand environments](../03-environments/02-up.mdx) for
[distributed applications](../../guides/components/01-architecture/04-microservices.mdx).

Every time a component is deployed with Architect, it will automatically deploy (if needed) and
connect to cited dependencies. Perhaps even more impressive than that is that it will also deploy
the dependencies OF your component's dependencies and ensure they're integrated as well.

Without dependency management integrated into deployments, each and every application would have to
maintain a complex web of CI pipelines or centralized infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates to
create new environments which can be an educational and logistical nightmare. With Architect, all
you ever need to know is your immediate dependencies and the rest will be automated for you.

## Registering dependencies

Before we can begin using dependencies, we need to create a component that we want to act as a
dependency for another. Let's start by creating a new component that we'll call the `backend` of our
project. The command below will help you create a new component from one of Architect's starter
projects.

```sh
$ architect init backend
```

Now that we have the project created, let's go ahead and register it with Architect. This will
simply build the services into docker images and publish everything to Architect's cloud registry.

```sh
$ architect register ./backend --tag latest --account my-account
```

## Using dependencies

Now that we have a component in the registry, we can use it as a dependency for another one. Let's
create a second project and call it `frontend`.

```sh
$ architect init frontend
```

Next, let's open up `./frontend/architect.yml` in our favorite IDE so we can add the dependency.
First, let's cite the dependency so that the backend will be deployed alongside the frontend. Add
the following to the component configuration:

```yaml architect.yml
dependencies:
  backend: {}
```

Next, we'll need to ensure the frontend service has access to the backend API. Find the
`environment` variables of the `app` service and add the following:

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./
    environment:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ dependencies.backend.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
```

Finally, let's deploy our application! We haven't written any code to connect to the backend API,
but you'll see that the backend got automatically deployed, and you're welcome to go try writing
features that leverage it.

## Debugging dependencies

By default Architect will pull dependencies down from the cloud registry on every deployment. But if
you want to test changes to, two components at once, you can do so by linking the dependency to your
host machine with `architect link`:

```sh
# Tells architect to use the local source code to fulfill dependencies on the `backend`
$ architect link ./backend/

# Will build and connect to the backend code found locally instead of the docker images pulled from Architect Cloud
$ architect dev ./frontend/
```
