Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to
indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit
loading resources. By default, requests from the same domain, schema, and port are allowed by CORS,
but it is common to use different subdomains for different apps and services in cloud environments
which can create the need to configure CORS explicitly.

Architect helps application developers automatically configure CORS for their applications by
facilitating the injection of the external [ingress](/components/ingress-rules) URLs into the
application. This is normally used to help client-side applications connect to the external address
of backend APIs, but can also be used by the backend APIs to allow the frontend address to be used
as a valid CORS origin.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  frontend:
    image: my-image:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 3000
        ingress:
          subdomain: app
    environment:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ services.backend.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}

  backend:
    image: my-backend:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
    environment:
      CORS_ORIGIN: ${{ services.frontend.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}
```

In the example above, the backend has an environment variable called `CORS_ORIGIN` that will
automatically be populated with the external address of the frontend service. From there, developers
can use the value to automatically configure CORS as shown in the
[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) example below:

```js
var express = require('express');
var cors = require('cors');
var app = express();

app.use(
  cors({
    origin: process.env.CORS_ORIGIN,
    optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
  })
);

app.get('/products/:id', function (req, res, next) {
  res.json({ msg: 'This is CORS-enabled for all origins!' });
});

app.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('CORS-enabled web server listening on port 8080');
});
```

Architect helps by dynamically injecting the CORS origin addresses into your application, but every
web framework uses different schemas for configuring CORS. Be sure to consult the documentation for
your framework on how to configure the CORS origin address.
