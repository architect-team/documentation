description: How to setup hot-reloading with NextJS applications
---

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an extremely popular React framework that helps developers create
full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating powerful
Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

A big part of the Next.js origin story is the ability to create static websites using React that can
be delivered quickly and cost-effectively via CDNs and edge functions. In order to help with that
experience for developers, Next.js includes some excellent tools out of the box that help developers
quickly iterate on their code via hot-reloading.

Architect runs [services](/components/services) inside Docker containers to ensure that the
applications run in consistent, reliable environments, but using containers for local development
requires some extra steps to ensure that code changes (which happen on the host) get mapped into the
container environment.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./
    debug:
      command: next dev
      volumes:
        pages:
          host_path: ./pages
          mount_path: /app/pages
```

The component spec introduces a few `debug` features - ones that only run locally using the
`architect dev` command. The first is an override to the default `command` run by the `Dockerfile`
(usually `next start` for Next.js sites).

The second is a volume that maps the local `pages` directory to the `/app/pages` directory inside
the container for your service (this assumes that the `WORKDIR` for your container is `/app`). This
will ensure that all file changes inside the `pages` directory will trigger hot-reloading inside the
container environment.

You can create additional volumes for other directories that contain application code like
`components` or `public` if you want to enable hot-reloading for the changes. However, a more
scalable answer might be to leverage the
[src directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory) feature of Next.js to put
all your code into a single `src` folder. This will allow you to create only a single volume for all
your application changes.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./
    debug:
      volumes:
        src:
          host_path: ./src
          mount_path: /app/src
```
