## Architect Cloud

Architect is a platform-as-a-service designed specifically for cloud native applications and
microservices. Every time an application (aka a Component) gets deployed, Architect automatically
deploys and integrates with all its required dependencies. This means that any application can be
deployed by anyone for any reason.

## How it works

Architect is built on the idea that cloud-native applications are more than their code or their container.
They need to connect to databases, need to publish or subscribe to events, and even need to connect to
other apps and APIs. Without those critical resources, most cloud applications are rendered useless. Architect
includes a native dependency manager that makes it easy for developers to integrate with external dependencies
and deploy said dependencies alongside their own applications.

## Components

The Architect Component framework is how developers define services, integrate with dependencies, and otherwise
declare the resources their application needs to run.

## Environments

Among the primary benefits of using Architect's Component framework is the portable nature of the Components themselves.
Since Architect automatically deploys required dependencies, the `architect deploy` command can be used to create new
environments as easily as it can be used to deploy to existing ones. This means that everyone can create a new, end-to-end
environment for their application with a single command.
