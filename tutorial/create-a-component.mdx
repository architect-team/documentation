title: "Create a Component"

---
This tutorial covers how you can quickly get started using Architect.

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for a smooth introduction to Architect:

- An application that can be run in a container. If you're just curious about what Architect has to offer,
  you can clone one of our [Starter Projects](https://github.com/architect-templates/) and use that to get
    started.
- Some familiarity with running applications using Docker (or any other similar
  container engine)

You don't need to know how to use Kubernetes or how to deploy an application
into a cloud environment - Architect handles that for you.

## Get Started

A component includes all the services and dependencies that comprise your application.
Creating a new component that can be run in Architect's community cloud as well as any external
clusters you add involves the following steps:

- Writing an `architect.yml` file
- Running and testing the component locally with `architect dev`
- Using the `architect register` command to register this component with your
  Architect account

If you don't yet have the Architect CLI installed,
[see our instructions on how to do that](/getting-started/introduction/#install-the-cli).

You can create your own component with a pre-existing app you've built, clone
one of our [Starter Projects](https://github.com/architect-templates/) yourself, or use our `init` command to clone it for you.

### Create a project using `architect init`

You can use the `architect init` command to clone one of our
[Starter Projects](https://github.com/architect-templates/) locally. A drop-down list of Starter Projects is
displayed for you to select from. The tutorial follows along with the
[React Starter Project](https://github.com/architect-templates/react), but you can
follow with whichever Starter Project you choose. We recommend selecting one that includes an frontend.

```bash
%architect init
? What is the name of your project? my-starter-project
? Please select a framework/language for your project React

To deploy locally, run:
	architect dev my-starter-project/architect.yml
```
### Create a component with a pre-existing app

Suppose we are working within a repository for a simple React app with the
following file structure:

```
src/
    index.js
Dockerfile
package.json
package-lock.json
```

We can create an `architect.yml` file for this repo so that we can easily run
our application locally **and** in the cloud with Architect.

## Defining a Component

### Component Metadata

First, we can add some metadata to the top of our `architect.yml` to help
identify our component.

```yaml
name: react
description: A react frontend component
```

The `name` and `description` will be visible on the Components page once the
component is registered.

### Defining a Service

Next, we can add a `services` section that defines one or more services that are
part of this component. Each service is defined by a top-level unique key that
you choose, and can be referenced in other sections of the `architect.yml`. Our
service will be called `my-app` in this example.

```yaml
name: react
description: A react frontend component

services:
  my-app:
    build:
      context: .
    interfaces:
      main: 8080
```

#### The build section

```yaml
build:
  context: .
```

The `build` section specifies details necessary for Architect to build an image
for this service via Docker. `context` tells Architect what directory to build
from, relative to the `architect.yml`. In this case, `architect.yml` is in the
same directory as our application, so we specify the path `.`. By default,
Architect expects a dockerfile named `Dockerfile` at the provided context to
build the image.

Other configuration options for the `build` section
[can be found here](/components/services/).

#### The interfaces section

```
interfaces:
  main:
    port: 8080
```

The `interfaces` section contains a set of named interfaces that the service
listens for requests on. Defines an interface named `main` that listens for
requests on port `8080` over http.

Importantly, this `interfaces` definition within the services section does not
expose the service publicly. In order for a service to be reached by outside
users or applications, see
[Defining an Interface](/tutorial/create-component/#defining-an-interface).

The protocol, port, hostname, and more are also available as configuration
options for the `interfaces` section.
[Details can be found here](/components/services).

An in-depth breakdown of the available configuration options for a service
[can be found here](/components/services).

### Defining an Ingress

In order to reach our service from a browser, we must create an ingress on the
interface we just created. Which defines the subdomain that will be used to
expose the interface externally.

```yaml
interfaces:
  main:
    port: 8080
    ingress:
      subdomain: test
```

The final version of the `architect.yml` should look like:

```yaml
name: react
description: A react frontend component

services:
  my-app:
    build:
      context: .
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: test
```

### Running Locally

Our `architect.yml` currently defines a very basic service that only has a
static frontend and an interface that allows us to connect to it. We will fix
that shortly, but we already have enough to create a component.

In order to test that the `architect.yml` is set up correctly, we can run:

```sh
$ architect dev architect.yml
```

After the image is built, you will be able to see your frontend at
`https://test.localhost.architect.sh`. Notice that the subdomain `test` is
coming from our defined ingress subdomain.

### Registering a Component to be deployed on the Cloud

In order to deploy this service to the Architect Cloud, we can run:

```sh
$ architect login
```

If you have not registered yet,
[create an account](https://cloud.architect.io/login). Once you've successfully
logged in, you can now register the component by running:

```sh
$ architect register architect.yml
```

Now, when you view the Components page on https://cloud.architect.io, you will
see a component named `react` that was just registered! Try deploying the app in
the cloud by clicking the "Deploy" button on the component card.
