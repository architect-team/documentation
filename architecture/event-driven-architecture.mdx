description: How to use event-driven architecture with Architect

Event-driven architecture is a powerful design pattern that allows cloud applications to make
calls to one another asyncronously and without coupling. This has been a pattern rapidly adopted
by microservice applications to increase resiliance of inter-process communication.

Integrations may be more resiliant with event-driven architecture compared to syncronous API calls,
but that doesn't mean your application doesn't have dependencies. If you subscribe to an event you
can safely run your application even if the publisher doesn't exist, but why would you want to? Your
application would be listening, but nothing would be talking to it. It'd just be burning compute.

By using Architect's dependency management features, developers can still take advantage of the
asyncronous nature of event-driven architecture, but are empowered to create end-to-end environments
that automatically deploy the event-publishers to aid in testing.

## Brokers

The first part of any event-driven application is a broker - a database or persistence layer that
oftentimes includes features to mediate the relationship between event publishers and subscribers. 
A few examples include [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/),
[Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), or managed service providers like [GCPs PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)
or AWSs [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)/[SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).

In this guide, we'll be using GCP PubSub. The first step is to define our pubsub Architect Component:

```yaml architect.yml
name: gcp-pubsub

secrets:
  gcp_project_id:
    description: Name of the GCP project to connect to
    default: test
  service_endpoint:
    description: If you want to connect to the remote pub/sub service, use the value 'pubsub.googleapis.com'. Otherwise, the local emulator will be used.
    required: false
  service_protocol:
    description: If you want to connect to the remote pub/sub service, use the value 'https'. Otherwise, the local emulator will be used.
    default: http
  service_port:
    description: If you want to connect to the remote pub/sub service, use the value '443'. Otherwise, the local emulator will be used.
    default: 8085

services:
  pubsub:
    image: gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk:emulators
    command: gcloud beta emulators pubsub start --host-port=0.0.0.0:${{ secrets.service_port }} --project=${{ secrets.gcp_project_id }}
    interfaces:
      main:
        host: ${{ secrets.service_endpoint }}
        protocol: ${{ secrets.service_protocol }}
        port: ${{ secrets.service_port }}
        ingress:
          subdomain: pubsub
```

The GCP team has gone above and beyond to help developers test their integrations by providing local
emulators for pub/sub. This component uses the emulator to make it easier to test the integration
without needing a cloud account.

Let's write the file to our filesystem and then register it with Architect:

```sh
$ architect register ./pubsub/architect.yml --tag latest --account my-account
```

## Publishers

Next up is an event publisher - a service that will write events to our broker for others to 
subscribe to. The only thing a publisher depends on is the broker itself, and doesn't really
care who the subscribers are.

```yaml architect.yml
name: publisher

secrets:
  publish_topic:
    description: Topic name the service will publish events to
    default: topic

outputs:
  publish_topic:
    description: Topic name events will be published to
    value: ${{ secrets.publish_topic }}

dependencies:
  gcp-pubsub: {}

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./
    environment:
      GCP_PROJECT_ID: ${{ dependencies['gcp-pubsub'].outputs.gcp_project_id }}
      PUBSUB_ENDPOINT: ${{ dependencies['gcp-pubsub'].services.pubsub.interfaces.main.url }}
      PUBSUB_TOPIC: ${{ secrets.publish_topic }}
```

The component above shows how event publishers can coordinate with upstream subscribers
by advertising the event topic using architect `outputs`. This will allow subscribers
to get the correct topic name without hardcoding to something that the publisher may want
to change later.

Let's go ahead and register the publisher so that other components can subscribe to its
events:

```sh
$ architect register ./publisher/architect.yml --tag latest --account my-account
```

## Subscribers

Finally, we're ready to setup our subscriber. Even though we're not making a call to the
event publisher, we still want to cite it as a dependency because our application won't
do anything of substance with those events being published.

```yaml architect.yml
name: subscriber

secrets:
  subscription_key:
    description: Key used to define this subscriber
    default: subscriber

dependencies:
  gcp-pubsub: {}
  publisher: {}

services:
  api:
    build:
      context: ./
    environment:
      PUBSUB_ENDPOINT: ${{ dependencies['gcp-pubsub'].services.pubsub.interfaces.main.url }}
      GCP_PROJECT_ID: ${{ dependencies['gcp-pubsub'].outputs.gcp_project_id }}
      PUBSUB_TOPIC: ${{ dependencies['publisher'].outputs.publish_topic }}
      PUBSUB_SUBSCRIPTION: ${{ secrets.subscription_key }}
```

Notice how the subscribe depends on both the `gcp-pubsub` component and the `publisher` component.
PubSub is used as the broker so that the service can read the events, but the topic name is
collected from the publisher so that we don't hardcode to something that may change.
