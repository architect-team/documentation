Designing, testing, and deploying microservices is a huge undertaking involving infrastructure design,
network security, complex CI pipelines, and more. But Architect makes all that easier with one simple
feature - **dependencies**.

Every language and operating system on earth has tools for managing and injecting dependencies into
applications, but developers lack similar tools for integrating microservices.

Developers can use Architect to declare their API and microservice dependencies, and every time they
deploy Architect will guarantee their dependencies exist. If they don't, Architect will deploy them!

## Designing a microservices app

To get an understanding of how microservices can use dependency management, let's create a few different
Architect components.

1. A `payments` component responsible for securing credit card details and processing payments
2. An `auth` component responsible for user credentials and authentication
3. A `backend` component that will be the primary API our webapp uses, and
4. A `frontend` component that will be the website our users interact with

Be sure to look at the `dependencies` block for each component to see how they all relate to each other.

<CodeGroup>
```yaml frontend
name: frontend

dependencies:
  backend: {}
  auth: {}

services:
  app:
    image: my-frontend-image:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environments:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ dependencies.backend.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
      AUTH_URL: ${{ dependencies.auth.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
```

```yaml backend
name: backend

dependencies:
  auth: {}
  payments: {}

databases:
  main:
    description: Stores misc application data
    type: postgres:13
  cache:
    description: Fast cache for responding to API calls
    type: redis:5

services:
  api:
    image: my-backend-image:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environment:
      DB_ADDR: ${{ databases.main.url }}
      CACHE_ADDR: ${{ databases.cache.url }}
      PAYMENTS_URL: ${{ dependencies.payments.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
      AUTH_URL: ${{ dependencies.auth.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
```

```yaml payments
name: payments

databases:
  card-data:
    description: Houses credit card data
    type: postgres:13

services:
  api:
    image: my-payments-image:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environment:
      DB_ADDR: ${{ databases.card-data.url }}
```

```yaml auth
name: auth

databases:
  user-data:
    description: Houses user login data
    type: postgres:13

services:
  api:
    image: my-auth-image:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environment:
      DB_ADDR: ${{ databases.user-data.url }}
```
</CodeGroup>

Note that the `frontend` component only depends on the `backend` component, but if you were to deploy
it you'd see that all 4 components would get deployed. 

By analyzing the full dependency graph for you, Architect helps developers focus less on what they know
about their own applications instead of having to learn the web of dependencies underneath them.

## Registering components

Architect resolves dependencies by calling out to the Architect Cloud registry to find matching components
and pull them into the target environment. That means that components need to be registered with Architect
Cloud before they can be used as dependencies.

To show how the registration works, let's create and register components like the ones described earlier:

```sh
# Create and register the auth component
$ architect init auth
$ architect register ./auth --tag latest --account my-account

# Create and register the payments component
$ architect init payments
$ architect register ./payments --tag latest --account my-account

## Create and register the backend component
$ architect init backend
$ vim ./backend/architect.yml  # Make sure to update the `dependencies` to include the `auth` and `payments` components
$ architect register ./backend --tag latest --account my-account

## Create and run the frontend
$ architect init frontend
$ vim ./frontend/architect.yml  # Make sure to update the `dependencies` to include the `backend` component
$ architect dev ./frontend
```

Notice how we only registered 3 out of 4 of the components we designed earlier. We only need to register
components that will be used as dependencies for others, so we don't need to register the frontend. When
we run `architect dev ./frontend`, Architect will automatically identify the auth, payments, and backend
components as required, pull them down, and run them alongside the frontend.

## Debugging multiple components

Microservices are great, but its not uncommon to need to debug full-stack application changes across multiple
services at the same time. Architect includes a `link` command for just this purpose.

Running `architect link` on a component folder or `architect.yml` file will put the folder into a local
registry. That way when other components cite the linked one as a dependency, Architect will find it locally
instead of in the cloud registry and will build it from the local source.

```sh
$ architect link ./backend
$ architect dev ./frontend
```

Since we ran the `link` command on the backend, the next run of `architect dev` will build the backend from
the local source instead of using `backend:latest` from the registry.
