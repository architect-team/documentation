title: Static websites
description: Declare and deploy static websites using Architect
---

Static websites are all the rage when it comes to fast-loading frontend applications. They're
cheap to operate because they can easily be cached by your favorite CDNs for edge distribution.

In this guide, you'll learn all about testing and debugging static websites using Architect and
employing common CDNs for improved production performance. If you want to skip the tutorial and
start from a working project, feel free to run `architect init` to have everything done for you.

## Creating the service

The interesting thing about _developing_ static sites is that they're never static when they're
actively being worked on. If you're making code changes, the whole site needs to be recompiled
before it can be rendered.

Fortuntely, Architect makes it easy for developers to create components with different behavior for dev
and production deployments. Developers can use different dockerfiles or commands using the `debug` block
to facilitate hot-reloading in their favorite languages and frameworks.

## Setup caching w/ Cloudflare

... describe how to set up Cloudflare for caching ...

You can set caching for an individual endpoint or set for specific set of endpoint.

### Set up cache for one endpoint:
``` js
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  // Cache for one week
  res.set('cache-control', 'public, max-age=604800');
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

### Set up cache for all requests that have url starting with `/static/`
``` js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.set('port', (process.env.PORT || 3000));
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));

// Add cache headers to responses
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  // Cache all assets with request url starting with /static/ for one week
  if (req.url.startsWith('/static/')) {
    res.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=604800');
  }

  next();
});
```
To check that the cache is working, you can check Network on your browser.
