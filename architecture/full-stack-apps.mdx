description: How to design and run a full-stack application component with Architect
---

Full-stack applications are the bread and butter of Architect. Our component framework has been
designed specifically to make it as easy as possible to package up modern applications into 
portable, deployable units.

In this guide, you'll learn how to create and deploy an Architect Component that includes a
database, a dockerized API service, and a static frontend web app. 

## Databases

The first building block of a full-stack web application is its database. Our full-stack app needs
to persist user data, so we'll need a reliable place to store it. Let's start by adding a database
to our `architect.yml` file:

```yaml architect.yml
databases:
  main:
    type: postgres:13
    description: Stores user data
```

The above will ensure that a new database is created for your component that uses `postgres` version `13`.
It also includes a small description of what the database is used for so that production engineering teams
have some visibility into what the cloud resources in the environment are used for.

## The backend

Next up, we'll want to add our dockerized backend API. Let's start by running `architect init` to bootstrap
a new project using one of our favorite languages and frameworks.

```sh
$ architect init backend
```

<Note>
  This new project includes its own `architect.yml`, but you can delete it. This guide creates one macro
  component that includes both the frontend and backend resources.
</Note>

Now that you have a new `backend` folder with the project code, let's create the service in our root
`architect.yml` file. This should be the same file we added the database to.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
    environment:
      DATABASE_ADDR: ${{ databases.main.url }}
```

As you can see, we also included a reference to the database inside the `DATABASE_ADDR` environment
variable. This uses Architect's [expression syntax](/components/architect-yml) to automatically fill
the value with our database address every time we deploy.

## The frontend

Finally, we're ready to create our frontend. Let's run the `architect init` command again to create
our frontend project:

```sh
$ architect init frontend
```

Now that you have a new `frontend` folder with the project code, let's create the service for our
frontend app:

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 3000
        ingress:
          subdomain: app
    environment:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ services.backend.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}
```

Just like with the backend service connecting to the database, the frontend service has injected the
public URL of the backend service into itself as the `BACKEND_ADDR` variable.

## Putting it all together

Now that we've seen the parts, let's put it all together.

```yaml
name: my-component

databases:
  main:
    type: postgres:13
  
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
    environment:
      DATABASE_ADDR: ${{ databases.main.url }}
      CORS_ORIGIN: ${{ services.frontend.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}
  
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 3000
        ingress:
          subdomain: app
    environment:
      BACKEND_ADDR: ${{ services.backend.interfaces.main.ingress.url }}
```

Did you catch the `CORS_ORIGIN` address in the backend service this time? Check out
