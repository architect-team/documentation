description: Learn how to create portable, cloud-native components with Architect
---

Components are Architect's version of cloud applications. We call them components because they represent
more than just your code. They include the databases your application needs to connect to, the API
gateway rules that need to be configured, and even the other APIs they depend on. By making room for
these declarations, developers can create truly portable applications that can be deployed anywhere
by anyone.

This guide will teach you about designing your `architect.yml` file. If you'd prefer to get started more
quickly with your favorite language or framework, check out our [starter projects](/getting-started/starter-projects).

## Creating a component

The Component framework is designed to provide all the benefits of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) and CI pipelines
without having to learn either infrastructure or workflow logistics. Instead, developers simply describe the
resources their application needs and the relationship between them so Architect can automate both infrastructure
and CI/CD pipelines for you.

### Metadata

Adding metadata like `name`, `description`, and `keywords` to your component allows it to be indexed in
Architect's cloud registry. This helps your team discover the component and use it as a dependency.

```yaml
name: payments
description: API for payment processing
keywords:
  - payments
  - credit
  - debit
  - pci-compliant
```

### Services

Next up is the declaration of your APIs. Components can include one or more API "service" that
will be deployed by your application. The syntax is largely inspired by [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/),
and users of docker compose should find it very familiar:

```yaml
services:
  my-api:
    build:
      context: .
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
    environment:
      MY_VAR: my-key
```

### Cronjobs

Components can also include one or more "tasks" that can be run on a schedule (e.g. cronjobs)
or triggered manually in an environment. Tasks support most of the same fields as services, 
but cannot add `interfaces` to listen for requests on.

```yaml
tasks:
  my-cron:
    schedule: 0 3 * * 0
    build:
      context: .
    environment:
      MY_VAR: my-key
```

### Databases

Need to ensure a database gets provisioned alongside your services so you can store persistent
data? Simply declare your databases and types right inside your component. No infrastructure
knowledge required!

```yaml
databases:
  user-data:
    type: postgres:13
```

### Secrets

Need to pass in variables to your component unique to each environment? Architect components can
declare `secrets` that can be used to configure your application at deploy-time:

```yaml
secrets:
  api-key:
    description: External API key
    required: true
```

### Dependencies

Want to connect two components together? Architect includes a native dependency resolver so that
you can easily extend the work of others using common dependency management tactics.

```yaml
dependencies:
  auth: {}
```

### Integrating resources

Declaring the resources in a simple, infrastructure-agnostic way isn't the only benefit of using 
Architect's Component framework. Architect also includes the ability to reference service interfaces,
databases, and dependencies using its [expression](/components/architect-yml) references:

```yaml
services:
  my-api:
    environment:
      DB_ADDR: ${{ databases.user-data.url }}
      API_ADDR: ${{ services.my-api.interfaces.main.url }}
      AUTH_ADDR: ${{ dependencies.auth.services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
```
