description: Learn how to setup cronjobs to run with your component

There are some scripts and processes that support applications that don't serve
traffic and aren't intended to be run as persistent services. Sometimes
developers might need to execute these tasks manually at their discression, and
sometimes they might want them to be run on a schedule.

By defining task definitions inside Architect components, developers can make
use of all the same service discovery and security benefits afforded to
persistent services - making it much easier and safer to execute tasks.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  api:
    image: my-api:latest
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 5432

tasks:
  run-reports:
    # run every sunday at 3am
    schedule: 0 3 * * 0
    build:
      context: .
    command: node run-reports.js
    environment:
      API_ADDR: ${{ services.api.interfaces.main.url }}
```

The example above will schedule the `run-reports` task to be run every sunday at 3am. The task
will have full access to the api service due to the injection of the service address in the 
`API_ADDR` environment variable.

## Configuration options

Cronjobs (aka `tasks`) support almost all of the same configuration options as [services](/components/services).
The only feature of services NOT supported by cronjobs is the `interfaces` feature. Cronjobs aren't
persistent services which means they can't respond to incoming API requests reliably.

The only field unique to cronjobs is the `schedule` field. This field is a cron string indicating the
schedule at which the task will run. Architect will ensure the cronjobs are instrumented correctly
regardless of where the task is deployed.

<Note>
  The schedule is ignored when running locally since the environments are temporary and primarily used
  for debugging.

## Testing cronjobs

To test or otherwise manually execute a cronjob task, simply run the `task:exec` command in the CLI:

```yaml
$ architect task:exec component-name task-name --account my-account --environment my-environment
```

To target locally running environments, use the `--local` flag instead of the `--account` and `--environments` flags.
