## Subdomain

A common need for applications is to expose themselves to outside traffic.
Public facing webapps and APIs are the primary means by which end users interact
with applications, so its important for components to be able to declare this
need. To expose your app or API to outside traffic, all you need to do is
declare an ingress rule for your component interface. Right now there is only
one ingress rule field of note: `subdomain`.

Every environment gets allocated a base URL used to fulfill all ingress traffic
in an environment. This base URL combined with the various ingress rules are
used to configure the API gateway installed on the cluster to faciliate and
broker secure traffic from the outside world to internal apps and services.
Below is an example of a component that declares a single interface with an
attached ingress rule:

```yaml
name: example-component

services:
  frontend:
    interfaces:
      app:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: app

  backend:
    environment:
      FRONTEND_INTERNAL: ${{ services.frontend.interfaces.app.url }}
      FRONTEND_EXTERNAL: ${{ services.frontend.interfaces.app.ingress.url }}
```

The above component declares a configurable ingress rule to listen on a
subdomain (by default, "app"). You can then deploy the component with a single
line into an environment and it will automatically be exposed via the API
gateway:

```sh
# The following command will expose the interface at https://app.dev.example.arc.domains
$ architect deploy example-component:latest -a example -e dev
```

### Whitelisting IP addresses

Ingresses of Architect components can be individually whitelisted by IP
addresses or CIDR blocks. Below is an example of a component where the `app`
endpoint is only available if the user's IP address is 100.100.100.100 or the IP
address falls in the range 10.0.0.0/16.

```
name: example-component

services:
  frontend:
    interfaces:
      app:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          enabled: true
          ip_whitelist:
            - 100.100.100.100
            - 10.0.0.0/16
```

Note that if you wish to use this feature on an EKS cluster, manual changes must
be made. Once cluster apps are installed to the corresponding Architect cluster,
find the target groups on the AWS dashboard that were created in your VPC that
begin with the prefix `k8s-arcmanag-traefik`. Under the `Attributes` tab, make
sure that `Proxy protocol v2` and `Preserve client IP addresses` are set to
`Enabled`.

Path-based routing It may be ideal in certain scenarios to expose multiple
service interfaces on the same subdomain. For this reason, external interfaces
can be configured with a `path` which will be used for path-based routing. In
the case of the example component below, both services are configured to be
accessible on the `www` subdomain. Users that access a URL beginning with `/api`
will be routed to the `api` service, while other URLs will lead to the `app`
service.

```yaml
name: example-component

services:
  api:
    interfaces:
      api-main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: www
          path: /api
          enabled: true
  app:
    interfaces:
      app-main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: www
          path: /
          enabled: true
```
