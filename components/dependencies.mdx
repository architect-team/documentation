title: "Dependencies"
---

Historically this complex web of services has been hard to manage, hard to
reason about, and hard for developers to contribute to.

Fortunately, the graphing and collaboration problems this creates have been
solved before. We've seen it with object-oriented programming and inheritance,
and even more recently with package and dependency management. All of our
favorite languages have a way for developers to utilize dependencies through a
resolver to handle the artifact storage, complex graphing, and de-duplication
needed to manage them at-scale. Architect takes this same approach to make it
easier than ever for developers to extend cloud services.

## Utilizing dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  authentication: {}

services:
  my-api:
    interfaces:
      http: 8080
    environment:
      AUTH_INTERNAL: ${{ dependencies.authentication.services.auth.interfaces.main.url }}
      AUTH_EXTERNAL: ${{
        dependencies.authentication.services.auth.interfaces.main.ingress.url
        }}
```

Just like with your favorite package manager, developers can cite the names
of the components that they need to make calls to. A tagged version of the dependency
can optionally be included as part of the `architect deploy` command. If no tag is
specified, the `latest` tag is implied. If the dependency already is deployed to the
remote environment, instead of re-deploying the `latest` tagged version, the currently
deployed version is used.

## Dependency referencing syntax

We've already shown how Architect enables developers to take advantage of
[service discovery](/components/service-discovery) for connecting to peer
services, and the same approach can be used to connect to the interfaces of
component dependencies. Once you've specified a dependency in your component,
you can reference the interfaces of said dependency using the
`${{ dependencies.*.services.*.interfaces.* }}` expression context.

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| url      | The fully composed URL of the reference interface. This will take the format, `<protocol>://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port><path>`.                                          |
| protocol | The protocol of the interface being referenced. This will always be the specific value assigned to the interface by the developer.                                               |
| username | The username of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have usernames, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                               |
| password | The password of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have passwords, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                               |
| host     | The host value of the interface being referenced. This value is usually dynamic to accomodate the differences between service discovery solutions available to each environment. |
| port     | The port value of the interface being referenced.                                                                                                                                |
| path     | The path value of the interface being referenced. Not all interfaces have paths, so this will be an empty string if none is set.                                                 |
