description: Define variables that should be injected into your component at deploy-time

Architect helps automate a huge chunk of application configuration by injecting the addresses and
details of other components and services, but there are still many cases where you'd need to provide
critical values manually like credentials for external services.

Architect makes it easy for component authors to declare the variables their application needs by
using `secrets`.

```yaml
secrets:
  secret_key:
    default: default-value
    description: My description
    required: false
```

Secrets can include three key bits of information: a `default` value, a human-readable `description`,
and a `required` field indicating whether or not the variable is required for the component to run.

Architect also supports a short-hand for secrets that will frequently rely on the default value 
(e.g. log_level):

```yaml
secrets:
  secret_key: default-value
```
