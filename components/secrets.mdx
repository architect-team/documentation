```yaml
secrets:
  secret_key:
    default: default-value
    description: My description
    required: true
```

In order to make it easier to describe secrets, Architect also supports a
shorthand that allows developers to quickly assign default values:

```yaml
secrets:
  secret_key: default-value
```

## Assigning secret values

To learn more about assigning values for secrets, see the docs on environment
configuration:
