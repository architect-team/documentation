Spinning up local environments is done entirely by Architect's CLI with the
[`architect dev`](/environments/local) command, but deploying into remote infrastructure, like
Architect Cloud or your own Kubernetes cluster, is facilitated by Architect's hosted continuous
delivery product. 

## Creating environments

Unlike local environments, remote environments have the potential for multiple people to deploy into
the same environment. This means environments get created separately from deploying into them to
enable multiple people or applications to target the same environment.

```sh
$ architect environment:create staging --account my-account
```

The command above will create a new environment called `staging` that can be targeted with deployments by
you and other members of your team. But right now its just an empty namespace.

## Deploying

There are several ways to deploy Architect Components to environments via Architect's continuous delivery
platform. Find the method that works best for your workflow and give it a shot.

### From source

The most common way to deploy applications is to deploy directly from source. This is a great command
to instrument using GitOps to make sure your code source mirrors the code running in your environment.

```sh
$ architect deploy ./frontend/architect.yml --account my-account --environment staging
```

### From the registry

Another way to deploy is by releasing components that have already been registered in Architect's cloud
registry. This is perfect for applications used as dependencies and for promoting previously built artifacts
to higher level environments without re-building code (e.g. staging to production).

```sh
$ architect deploy auth
```

### Using specific tags

Just like with Docker, Architect Components get registered with different artifact tags that can be used to
differentiate between versions of the component. Different teams use different tag naming conventions, but
specifying a tag during deployments is as easy as including `:<tag-name>` after the component name in the
deploy command.

```sh
$ architect deploy auth:v1
```

### Using specific dependency tags

By default, Architect assumes the usage of the `latest` tag when a tag isn't specified during deploy commands.
This is true both for explicit deployments and implicit dependencies. To override which tag is used for a
component dependency, just specify the component and tag explicitly when deploying:

```sh
$ architect deploy frontend:v1 backend:v2
```

The command above will deploy `v1` of the frontend component and `v2` of the backend component. That v2 instance
of the backend will fulfill the dependency on the backend from the frontend or any other component that depends
on it deployed to the same environment.

## Cleaning up

Ready to clean up your work after a successful test? With Architect you can remove individual components or
clean up entire environments with ease.

### Removing components

If you're working in a collaborative environment and just want to clean up your own components, you can do
so with the `architect destroy` command.

```sh
$ architect destroy <my-component> -e staging
```

You can also purge all components from the environment by providing no arguments to the command.

### Destroying the environment

Want to remove the entire environment from Architect so that no one can deploy to it anymore? You can do that
too with the `architect environment:destroy` command:

```sh
$ architect environment:destroy staging
```

## Managing environments with GitOps

Its important to understand how Architect environments and deployments work, but the best way to maximize the
time of your team is to wire up environment creation and deployments to run automatically via GitOps! Check
