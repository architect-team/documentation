title: Release environments
description: Triggering deployments whenever releases are cut
---

Release environments are those which get deployed to whenever a release is cut from your git
repository. This is a great way to ensure you have documented changesets associated with 
everything that goes to production.

Some version control provides have a formal concept of a "release", but for others
you can simply use tags.
