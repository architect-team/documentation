Architect.io manages the deployment pipeline to include secure secret
management, building, and deploying applications and their dependencies while
ensuring connections to dependant services, all in a declaritive way. Similar to
Docker or Kubernetes, you tell Architect.io what your desired state for the
application is and the build and deploy process ensures that secrets get
injected, dependant services are also built and deployed and accessible, all
while giving you access to deploy logs and the ability to easily roll back a
deployment if something goes wrong.
