## Adding a Backend

Our `architect.yml` can define multiple services, and our frontend application
isn't able to do much without a backend providing data.

You can add your own pre-existing backend service, or clone our
[Node Template](https://github.com/architect-templates/node-rest-api) to follow
along.

Suppose we are now working with our frontend and backend in separate
directories - note that our `architect.yml` is still in the `react-frontend/`
directory:

```
node-backend/
    src/
        index.js
    Dockerfile
    package.json
    package-lock.json
react-frontend/
    src/
        index.js
    Dockerfile
    package.json
    package-lock.json
    architect.yml
```

In `react-frontend/architect.yml`, we will add the following:

- The `api` service under services
- The a`pi-interface` under interfaces

```yaml
name: react-node-app
description: A react + nodejs component

services:
  my-app:
    build:
      context: .
    interfaces:
      main:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          subdomain: test
  api:
    build:
      context: ../node-backend
    interfaces:
      http:
        port: 3000
        ingress:
          subdomain: api
```

### Defining Another Service

In order for our component to deploy multiple services, we can add configuration
a second service within the `services` section. For this example, the additional
service is called `api`.

This `api` section has it's own build context and set of interfaces:

```yaml
build:
  context: ../node-backend
interfaces:
  http:
    port: 3000
    ingress:
      subdomain: api
```

We want to build our API from the `node-backend` directory, and can use the
relative path `../node-backend` to specify that. We also create an interface
named `http` that will listen on port 3000.

### Running Locally

This can be run locally using the same command as before:

```sh
$ architect dev architect.yml
```

This time, both `https://test.localhost.architect.sh` and
`https://api.localhost.architect.sh` will be available when the containers are
started, and the frontend will be able to make requests to the backend.

### Registering a Component to be deployed on the Cloud

The updated version of the component can be registered as well:

```sh
architect register architect.yml
```

This will allow you to deploy the component on the Architect Cloud from
`https://cloud.architect.io`, or via the command line utility
`architect deploy`.

### Next Steps

At this point, the `architect.yml` can evolve in whatever way is necessary to
fulfill the needs of your application. For example, it's likely necessary for
your API to have a database - that can be added as another service in the
`services` section. You may need to
[pass environment variables](/components/services/#environment) to your
services. Maybe your frontend and backend live in separate repo, and
[using dependencies](/components/dependencies) can help you keep them decoupled.

The rest of the Architect documentation has more in-depth information about what
`architect.yml` allows you do to.
