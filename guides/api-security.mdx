## Automated network security

<Note>
  This feature is only available in our **Growth** tier
</Note>

One of the silent benefits of using Architect's dependency management features is the ability
for our platform to generate Network policies automatically with each deployment. Architect
automatically reads in references to service interfaces to determine which applications are
designed to communicate with one another, and uses that metadata to enrich deployments with
strict, zero-trust network policies.

## IP whitelisting

Unlike for internal services, Architect has no idea who the intended users are for external
services exposed via ingress rules. By default, the API gateway is configured to allow traffic
from everywhere.

However, there are some cases where you'd want to limit who can access your applications. Architect
ingress rules can be configured individually to allow traffic only from specific IP addresses
or CIDR blocks.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  frontend:
    interfaces:
      app:
        port: 8080
        ingress:
          ip_whitelist:
            - 100.100.100.100
            - 10.0.0.0/16
```

<Warning>
  Requires extra steps for AWS EKS clusters
</Warning>

If you're deploying your component to a private, EKS cluster, you'll need to do one extra step to ensure
that the cluster API gateway receives the correct IP addresses from AWS.

Login to your AWS dashboard and find the target groups on that were created by the EKS cluster with the prefix,
`k8s-arcmanag-traefik`. For each group, click on the `Attributes` tab and make sure that `Proxy protocol v2` and
`Preserve client IP addresses` are set to `Enabled`.
