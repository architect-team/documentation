Distributed tracing refers to methods of observing requests as they propagate through distributed
systems. It's a diagnostic technique that reveals how a set of services coordinate to handle individual
user requests. A single trace typically shows the activity for an individual transaction or request
within the application being monitored, from the browser or mobile device down through to the database
and back. In aggregate, a collection of traces can show which backend service or database is having
the biggest impact on performance as it affects your users' experiences.

## OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs used to instrument, generate, collect, and export
telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior.

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of setting up OpenTelemetry in your applications and how to
connect to your preferred trace collector via Architect.
