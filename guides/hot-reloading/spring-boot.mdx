description: How to setup hot-reloading for Spring Boot applications
---

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) makes it easy to create stand-alone,
production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". Sprint Boot take an
opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with
minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

In this guide you'll learn how to setup hot-reloading for Architect Components that use 
Spring Boot services.

<CodeGroup>
```yml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    debug:
      build:
        dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
      volumes:
        # The name of the volume we are creating
        app:
          host_path: .
          mount_path: /opt/code/src
```

```dockerfile Dockerfile
FROM maven:3-openjdk-18 as build
WORKDIR /opt/code/src
COPY . .
RUN mvn package

FROM maven:3-openjdk-18-slim
COPY --from=build /opt/code/src/target/app.war app.war
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.war" ]
```

```dockerfile Dockerfile.dev
FROM maven:3-openjdk-18-slim
WORKDIR /opt/code/src
CMD [ "mvn", "spring-boot:run", "-Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=true" ]
```
</CodeGroup>

Take a look at the `architect.yml` file cited above, and first note the use of a different
`dockerfile` inside `debug.build` for your service. The production `Dockerfile` includes
all the steps to build the application before being served directly from a `.war` file,
but `Dockerfile.dev` skips all that and uses the command `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.devtools.restart.enabled=true`
to build the application from source and ensure that it uses the spring devtools to
continously reload the application when there are changes.

Secondly, the `architect.yml` file includes a volume to map the application source code to
from the host to the container runtime. This ensures that code changes are visible to the
docker container runtime so that spring boot can detect the changes.
