description: How to setup hot-reloading with NextJS applications
---

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an extremely popular React framework that helps developers
create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features, and integrating
powerful Rust-based JavaScript tooling for the fastest builds.

A big part of the Next.js origin story is the ability to create static websites using React
that can be delivered quickly and cost-effectively via CDNs and edge functions. In order to
help with that experience for developers, Next.js includes some excellent tools out of the
box that help developers quickly iterate on their code via hot-reloading.

Architect runs [services](/components/services) inside Docker containers to ensure that the
applications run in consistent, reliable environments, but using containers for local development
requires some extra steps to ensure that code changes (which happen on the host) get mapped into
the container environment. 

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./
    debug:
      command: next dev
      volumes:
        pages:
          host_path: ./pages
          mount_path: /app/pages
```

The component spec introduces a few `debug` features - ones that only run locally using the `architect dev` 
command. The first is an override to the default `command` run by the `Dockerfile` (usually `next start` for
Next.js sites). 

The second is a volume that maps the local `pages` directory to the `/app/pages` directory inside the container
for your service (this assumes that the `WORKDIR` for your container is `/app`). This will ensure that all file
changes inside the `pages` directory will trigger hot-reloading inside the container environment.

You can create additional volumes for other directories that contain application code like `components` or `public`
if you want to enable hot-reloading for the changes. However, a more scalable answer might be to leverage the 
[src directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/src-directory) feature of Next.js to put all your code
into a single `src` folder. This will allow you to create only a single volume for all your application changes.

```yaml architect.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./
    debug:
      volumes:
        src:
          host_path: ./src
          mount_path: /app/src
```
